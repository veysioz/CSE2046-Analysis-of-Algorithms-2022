# Algorithm Projects

<b>Marmara University / Computer Science & Engineering / CSE2046 - Analysis of Algorithms (2022)</b>

<b>Project I</b>

<p>In this project, we designed an experiment. In this experiment we compared different algorithms for the Selection Problem. Before starting the experiment, we created different input files (Best Case, Worst Case, Random Case). Then we did the experiment with these algorithms: Insertion-Sort, Merge-Sort, Quick-Sort (Pivot: First), Selection-Sort, Partial Heap-Sort, Quick-Select (Pivot: First), Quick Select (Pivot: Median of Three). Then we compared the results.</p>

<b>Project II</b>

<p>In this project, we designed an algorithm ourselves to solve the graphic coloring problem. In this problem, our goal is to colorize the entire graph so that no two adjacent vertices are the same color. In our solution, we designed an algorithm by accepting each vertex as an object and keeping its neighbors inside that object. In this way, we have come closer to the optimal solutions of the test inputs.</p>
